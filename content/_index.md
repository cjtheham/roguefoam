üëãüèª Hi, I'm Rogue and welcome to my personal website and blog.

The goal for this website is to act as a culmination of my random thoughts, projects, and ramblings across the internet. I plan on adopting the [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) method for content creation using this website as a primary hub.

My hobbies and topics you can expect to see on this website include: amateur radio, electrical engineering, [film](https://letterboxd.com/roguefoam/) and media, personal knowledge management, dart blaster modification, and other random one-off topics!

Want to find me across the internet and see what else I'm up to?

*   Find me on [Mastodon](https://defcon.social/@roguefoam) for more real-time thoughts and updates. I love having in-depth conversations on most any topic over there!
*   Check out my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/roguefoam) profile to see the movies I'm watching lately and my thoughts on them.
*   On the rare occassion I write code, it'll be published to my [Github](https://github.com/cjtheham) profile.
*   I try to post images of my projects and general life events over on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/roguefoam574) - feel free to follow there for the most dart blaster content!

Got suggestions on this site or find an issue? Feel free to mention me on Mastodon!
