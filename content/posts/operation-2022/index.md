At the time of writing this post, I've been a ham radio operator for around a year and 3 months. Over this time, my styles of operating have changed a lot. I started out as a technician, then moved to HF, and continued to move from there. The biggest part of this past year has been dedicated to DXing and contesting for me, but I think it's time for me to make a shift in my style of radio.

To give a little more context: in April 2021, I joined a program that allows youth radio operators to run remote HF stations for free. This is a great system that allows youth to get on the air without needing a huge home station that may be unaffordable or just impractical for them (HOA restrictions, condo, etc.). Since joining that program and getting my start in HF radio, I've had the fantastic opportunity to operate from some incredible "super-stations", running massive 100ft towers with multiple yagis, legal limit power, etc.

This experience has been great, and I've done some incredible things with access to such equipment. But, over the past few months my spark for DXing and hunting countries has started to die down, and I want to attribute this to operating fully remote.

Don't get me wrong - operating remote is incredible! But...jumping from a Baofeng UV-5R to 500w and a 3 el. yagi on HF is a pretty unconventional leap in this hobby. I've followed many people across social media and seen their starts, and what they do in the hobby, and it has encouraged me to want to push more towards DIY and other forms of operarating.

Here's a short list of some changes I plan to make to my operating style over the next couple years:
- I will be keeping two separate logs - one for remote operations and one for manual, "home" operations.
- I'll continue to run from the remote stations I have previously, but more casually. Net check-ins, working specific stations, etc.
- I will be trying to get a home base station up and on the air remotely with my IC-7300, so that my operation can still be remote but working with my own setup.
- While running portable in an apartment, I'll be focusing more on satellite operations and working towards the VHF Century Club awards.
- I will be trying to move more towards portable QRP activations, most likely using DIY kits and activating via either CW or SSB.

I hope to accomplish a lot of goals in my time in amateur radio, and I still have a lot to learn. In the meantime, I want to get back to having a lot more fun in radio again and most importantly to me - staying on the air while doing it.

And from here on out, I'll be trying to make at least one ham radio "bucket list" item for the year to work towards. Here's my goal for 2022: qualify to join the [CWops](https://cwops.org/membership/) club. Joining the club requires making contacts with at least 4 CWops members at 25+ words per minute. While this may be a stretch, I hope to at least be able to make contest level QSOs at 25 wpm by the end of 2022, or even the beginning of 2023.

Thanks for reading, and hope to work you on the air soon.
