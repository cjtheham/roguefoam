Amateur Radio is my primary hobby, and where I spend most of my free time. Here's some information about it, blog posts, and other content on the site regarding ham radio.

My callsigns include [WW0CJ](https://www.qrz.com/db/ww0cj) (US), [M7WCJ](https://www.qrz.com/db/M7WCJ) (UK), and [ZF2CJ](https://www.qrz.com/db/ZF2CJ) (Cayman Islands).
